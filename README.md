### Significance of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

Supervised and unsupervised learning are two fundamental approaches in machine learning, each serving distinct purposes in data analysis and modeling.

**Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where both input features and corresponding output labels are provided. The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen input data. Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks such as classification and regression, making it essential for applications like spam detection, image recognition, and price prediction.

**Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning involves training algorithms on unlabeled data, where only input features are available without corresponding output labels. The objective is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data. Unsupervised learning is valuable for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection, enabling applications such as customer segmentation, data compression, and fraud detection.

By exploring both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, this project aims to provide a solid foundation in data science and machine learning techniques, equipping students with the knowledge and practical skills needed to tackle real-world problems effectively.
